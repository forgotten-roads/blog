Researching that &amp;ndash; and endurance riding in general &amp;ndash; led me to the &lt;a href='http://www.ironbutt.com/'&gt;Iron Butt Association&lt;/a&gt; web site and their rides/certifications. So, when I pulled into my campsite last night and found that I was bivouacked next to someone doing the IBA's &lt;a href='http://www.ironbutt.com/themerides/48n10/'&gt;48 States Series&lt;/a&gt;, I was quite chuffed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://www.facebook.com/2ringbike/'&gt;@2ringbike&lt;/a&gt; seems a private man (he didn't give his name, and I didn't ask), but he was eager to have a quiet chat with another rider.  He'd just left home in Saskatchewan, Canada yesterday ... and was already sharing his ride status with his kids and wife (via &lt;a href='https://spotwalla.com/index.php'&gt;SpotWalla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href='http://bubblergps.com/'&gt;Bubbler GPS&lt;/a&gt;).  He's also riding with a GoPro which is configured to take a still shot every few seconds; he plans on compiling these into a video time-lapse of his trip and putting it on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This morning he starts on his journey of the lower 48 states. He's going to hop across the state border to Minnesota, then come back to North Dakota and head down to South Dakota, then on to Nebraska and points East after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was delighted to be there at the start of his journey, and play some small role in his story &amp;ndash; last night we used my phone's Yelp app (so that he didn't have to pay exorbitant international data fees) to find a coffeeshop where he can get his first certification today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can't think of a more excellent way to begin a morning ride that with a cappuccino :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Dam Ride 2017</title><updated>2017-06-15 22:31:22</updated><author><name>oubiwann</name></author><link href="http://forgotten.roads.mx/blog//blog/archives2017-06/15-223122/dam-ride-2017.html"></link><id>urn:forgotten-roads-mx/blog:feed:post:Dam Ride 2017</id><content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Three-day HOG-sponsored Ride&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year the local HOG sponsored a group ride that visited some of the hydro-electric dams in South Dakota, but I wasn't able to go. This year, I took time off from work to make sure I could participate in the three-day ride with three sister HOG chapters. I lucked out, because this year was a full-on event, complete with pin set, tail-gate party, sponsored meals, and support vehicles (which fortunately weren't needed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Route&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the starting point is in Fargo, ND this year, those of us riding up from Sioux Falls and Glacier Lakes got an early start on our ride. More on that below. The &lt;em&gt;official&lt;/em&gt; ride starts from Fargo, ND with open ended routes across the state to the Missouri and down into South Dakota for a night in Pierre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day is a ride across Native reservations, ranch land, and country roads, the James River valley, Yankton, and up to Sioux Falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Preparation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my last multi-day ride (3500+ miles), I was brand-new to distance riding and had quite the adventure with bags and packing &amp;ndash; not only was the trip on short notice, I didn't have any proper bags. All winter I'd been musing about bag arrangement and packing for my cruiser (Softail Slim S). That's a saga that will get a post of its own, but for now I will say that I put a LOT of thinking into the packing and preparation for this smaller ride ... it's going to be the first test of the next iteration of my packing system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my eagerness to see if everything fit (it did!), I got it all packed before taking any photos, but at the last minute my wife did remind me to get a shot of the gear that I will be wearing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/blog/img/dam-ride-gear-layout.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bright and early, a buddy from the local HOG group and I headed out, everything fully secure and packed tight:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/blog/img/dam-ride-pre.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Day 1&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We decided to take a scenic route just across the Minnesota border that would put us into Ortonville in time for lunch. This was my second trip up through this area (the last time was to visit the grave of Medal of Honor war hero &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_W._Keeble'&gt;Woodrow Keeble&lt;/a&gt;). The last time through Ortonville they were having their annual corn harvest festival. This time was more time, but even more delicious: we had burgers at the excellent &lt;a href='https://goo.gl/pZECGS'&gt;Headwaters Grill &amp; Bar&lt;/a&gt;. Yet another good reason to stop in Ortonville!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post-lunch ride was really fantastic &amp;ndash; nothing earth-shattering like riding the Rockies or Highway 1 to Big Sur, but just plain fun with beautiful scenery along &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Stone_Lake'&gt;Big Stone Lake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Traverse'&gt;Lake Traverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This last leg of the journey was a bit windy and we sometimes got smacked pretty hard, but the views were so great that the time passed without even feeling it and before we knew it we were in Fargo; We may actually have been the first to arrive:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/blog/img/dam-ride-fargo.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gave me enough time to head over to &lt;a href='http://www.fargoparks.com/facilities-recreation/lindenwood-campground.html'&gt;Lindenwood Campground&lt;/a&gt; where they gave me a great site right on the &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_River_of_the_North'&gt;Red River&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/blog/img/dam-ride-red-river.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/blog/img/dam-ride-camp-site.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up was a return to Harley-Davidson of Fargo for the kick-off party+BBQ,  then back to the campsite to set up the hammock, meet &lt;a href='/blog/archives/2017-06/16-170908/the-lower-48-challenge.html'&gt;2ringbike&lt;/a&gt;, and get some shut-eye:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/blog/img/dam-ride-hammock.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The Beginning of a New Project</title><updated>2016-09-19 22:13:43</updated><author><name>bobbermac</name></author><link href="http://forgotten.roads.mx/blog//blog/archives2016-09/19-221343/the-beginning-of-a-new-project.html"></link><id>urn:forgotten-roads-mx/blog:feed:post:The Beginning of a New Project</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I enjoy most about riding a motorcycle is the adventure; however, I don't ride a dual-sport bike; I ride a cruiser. I love the old look of the bobber motorcycles, but I like heading off into the unknown on forgotten byways and country roads &amp;ndash; tying a tarp to the bike as lean-to when it's time to rest, and then packing up in the dawn light for another day of sights and smells of the less-traveled lands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems that I'm not alone in this, yet there aren't many places online where one can read stories, take inspiration, or plan for the next such adventure. So, I thought it might be nice to provide one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forgotten Roads is for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; type of rider who's looking for kindred spirits of the tarmac, gravel, and dirt. We're not an MC, but rather an &lt;em&gt;MX&lt;/em&gt;; not a club, but a resource for the &lt;em&gt;motorcycle excursionist&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the coming months (and years!) you can expect posts on this blog that cover everything from personal adventures and stories to group events and rides; from lessons learned and hard-one personal experience to produce reviews. Of particular interest will be sharing excellent roads for riding, and how to get to them as well as friendships and acquaintances we form with random fellow excursionists we meet on these forgotten roads.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Knucklehead at Sturgis</title><updated>2016-07-31 11:49:41</updated><author><name>oubiwann</name></author><link href="http://forgotten.roads.mx/blog//blog/archives2016-07/31-114941/knucklehead-at-sturgis.html"></link><id>urn:forgotten-roads-mx/blog:feed:post:Knucklehead at Sturgis</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My wife and I were camping in the Black Hills this weekend, just as Sturgis is kicking into gear, and there are some amazing bikes on the road &amp;ndash; tons of group rides going on. The best sight of the day, though, has been the group of vintage Harleys and Indians we saw stopped at a burger joint on the side of the road. I pulled over real quick to snap some photos ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/blog/img/arctic-knucklehead-front.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The owner was chatting with another fellow, so I didn't get a chance to say much more than how much I liked is ride, but I did overhear that he had taken two trips to the Arctic Circle with his Knucklehead, and had put something far over 100,000 miles on it, with 2,600 miles of that being gravel roads. The second trip to the Arctic he had done for a buddy who wanted to make the trip with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/blog/img/arctic-knucklehead-side.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He loves adventure riding with the Knucklehead because it's so easy to fix: every time he's had a breakdown, he's been able to get it up and running with the tools he carried on him, even if just to limp along to the nearest garage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm kind of bummed that I only got the boots of the one guy - he was riding an Indian with a group of others, all of them dressed up in period racing gear. What a site! I guess I'll have to go back next year and get more photos :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
