At Forgotten Roads, our greatest passion is the adventure of riding a
motorcyle. We like heading off into the unknown on forgotten byways and
country roads -- tying a tarp to the bike as lean-to when it's time
to rest, and then packing up in the dawn light for another day of sights and
smells of less-traveled lands.

We are not alone in this, yet there aren't many places online where
one can read stories, take inspriation, or plan for the next such adventure.
Forgotten Roads is for *any* type of rider who's looking for kindred spirits
of the tarmac, gravel, and dirt. We're not an MC, but rather an *MX*; not a
club, but a resource for the *motorcycle excursionist*.

Our interests cover everything from personal adventures and stories to group
events and rides; from lessons learned and hard-one personal experience to
focused, pertinent product reviews. In particular, we share our discoveries of
roads as well as friendships and aquantainces we form with random fellow
excursionists on these forgotten roads.

We wrote a blog post that talks some more about why we started up this blog;
you can read that [here](/blog/archives/2016-09/19-221343/the-beginning-of-a-new-project.html).
