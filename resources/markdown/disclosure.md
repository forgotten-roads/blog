### Revenue from Advertising

Forgotten Roads provides free and helpful content to users who are interested
and care about the same things that we are. We also aim to
recoup some of that investment via discrete and topically appropriate
advertising provided to our readers, useful affiliate programs, and
any sponsorships that may arise in the course of time.

However, due to the fact that we write reviews, earn money from avertisements
in the motorcyle, camping, and general adventure industries, we want to be
100% above board in our endorsements, product reviews, and content creation
efforts. This has an impact on our ethics and ability to be a trusted source
of relevant information: we want to openly declare our revenue sources to our
readers. This way you may trust that when we say good things
about a product, you know we mean it and aren't being bought-off by companies
building empires on the crushed bones of abused bloggers and readers.

Rest assured: any time Forgotten Roads content contributors receive money to
write reviews, receive free products given with the intent that we would write
a review, or create any sort of content that benefits a sponsor or advertiser,
we make an explicit disclosure of those facts on the given blog post. We make
it clearly, cleanly, and obviosuly.


### It's the Law

As bloggers passionate about motorcycles, camping, and the freedom of
adventure, we want to let you know about any potential conflicts -- it's
just the right thing to do.

However, as content creators receiving revenue or gifts through advertisement,
affiliate programs, or sponsorship, it's also the law: the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) has released guidlines for bloggers regarding endorsements
and advertising:

If at any point you feel that we could do a better job in disclosing
releationships that Forgotten Roads may benefit from financially, either
explicitly or implicitly, please [let us know](/blog/contact.html).
