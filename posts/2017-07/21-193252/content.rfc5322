This is a quick blog post to share two new Google Maps themes we produced here
at Forgotten Roads, in the event that our readers might want to use these as
well. They've got a "retro" feel to them, designed to be extremely simple
(for easy viewing in blog posts) and pleasing to the eye. These two map styles
have been published in two locations (on the
[Snazzy Maps](https://snazzymaps.com/explore?text=oubiwann&sort=&tag=&color=)
&
[MapStylr](http://www.mapstylr.com/author/oubiwann/) sites), and
are of two types:

* Retro Muted ([Snazzy Maps](https://snazzymaps.com/style/110996/retro-muted) | [MapStylr](http://www.mapstylr.com/style/retro-muted/))
* Simple Retro Muted with Terrain ([Snazzy Maps](https://snazzymaps.com/style/111010/simple-retro-muted-with-terrain) | [MapStylr](http://www.mapstylr.com/style/simple-retro-muted-with-terrain/))

The second one is even more pared down than the first and is what we've settled
on for displaying ride data in our blog posts. Below I've included some example views of the style at different zoom levels.

### State Level Zoom

Here's a view of the lower half of South Dakota:

              :user forgottenroadsmx
              :width 1024 %}

In both this view and the next you can see how we've diminished the visibility
of US interstates to a mere hint, really focusing instead on the state routes
-- one of the most important sources of good riding!

### Metro Area Level Zoom

This shows the Rapid City metro area, outlying ranch land, and some of the Black Hills:

              :user forgottenroadsmx
              :width 1024 %}

### City Level Zoom

The next two show city views and two different zoom levels, emphasizing the labeling simplicity:
