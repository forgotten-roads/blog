A few weeks ago, we posted an update on Twitter showing
[Garage Obi-wan getting us ready to move](https://twitter.com/ForgottenRdsMX/status/916738281890607105).
Since then, a lot has happened, but most importantly: we're nearly packed and
ready to start the move next week.

While we do know he's from a galaxy far, far away and and a time long ago, we
don't <i>really</i> know how old Obi-wan is. Probably 10s of 1000s of years
old. So it's impressive that he could help out with the packing at all. Even
more, that he continues to do so:

Though, truth be told, he's falling a bit behind. Rory's got him beat pretty
hard (she's done 99% of the packing). No house shots, but here's one of our
Pick-Up Points for the movers :-)
